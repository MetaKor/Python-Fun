# Python-Fun
A collection of short Python 2.7 projects I've created during my CS class.
## Cooltext.py
* Returns cool text like that at the top of [Khan Acdemy](https://www.khanacademy.org/)'s source.
* Run it in your command shell.
  * Increase your command shell's horizontal char limit for long inputs.
* Type in plaintext.
  * Currently supports spaces, letters, digits, and basic punctation.

```
## TextAdvEngine.py
* Allows users to play **and add on to** .txt-based Text Adventures.
* Place an empty .txt file in the folder from which you'll be running it.
* Run it in your command shell (duh).
  * Don't forget the .txt when you specify your text file.
* Follow the in-game instructions to build upon and play your adventure.
  * Keep coming back to eventually create a fully-fleshed out story.
* Enjoy! I'm really quite proud of this.
